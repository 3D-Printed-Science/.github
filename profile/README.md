## 3D Printed Science

An organization to help organize and identify useful or instructive 3D prints for scientific research.

### Why Github?
Most 3D print repositories are great for sharing files, but what is missing is a solid way to track multiple versions and even design improvements from other designers.
Since scientific progress is fundamentally driven by these iterative improvements, sites like thingiverse are less ideal for this use case.

Additionally, github releases, in combination with zenodo, provide a consistent way to generate citable DOIs for designs,
so that designers can be properly credited for their work when it enables science outside of their own research!

### Contribution
We are eager to include additional designers work, and take pull requests to improve existing designs. 
To make this possible, we are asking contributors to upload model files in addition to standard STL files, 
so that designs can be iteratively improved.

If you would like to add a new design of your own, reach out to [Ben](mailto:benjamin.barad+3dprint@gmail.com) to be added to the organization!
If you want to add an iteration on a design, just open a pull request! No org membership needed. In both cases, we ask organizers to maintain releases
when versions are improved so that DOIs can be generated with Zenodo!

So far all designs are focused on Cryo-electron Tomography - but we welcome designs from across the fields of science - anything useful for research
or stem education is welcome.

I'd love to recruit additional organizers if anyone is interested in doing so!
